    <h1>Wireframes</h1>
    <div class="wireframes">
 <p class="center">   The following page contains the wireframes that will be used within initial paper prototyping and user testing.</p>
<p class="center">The grey backgrounds of these images represent the reflective surface of the mirror.</p>

<h3>Wireframe 1: Sleep Mode</h3>
<img src="images\sleep.JPG">
<p>When the user is not in the same room as the mirror, it will turn off the display, but will display a moon icon to indicate that the device is still turned on. When the user walks into the room, the homescreen will appear.</p>

<h3>Wireframe 2: Home Screen</h3>
<img src="images\home.JPG">
<p>Once the user walks into the room that the mirror is within, this display will appear. It aims to give the user key information such as the temperature, date and time. These elements are placed on the edges of the mirror in order to allow the user to use the mirror as they normally would. A message is also displayed at the top in order to motivate the user for their day ahead.</p>

<h3>Wireframe 3: Gmail Interface</h3>
<img src="images\gmail1.JPG">
<p>Using voice commands, the user can tell the mirror to check their emails. There is a small tutorial in the bottom corner of the screen that will only display the first time they use the feature unless they ask to renable the tutorial. The user can also open emails by using voice commands.</p>

<h3>Wireframe 4: Opening Emails</h3>
<img src="images\gmail2.JPG">
<p>Upon opening an email, the user will be presented with the subject of the email as well as its contents. The size of this window will depend on the length of the email. Eg, if there is a longer email, the window will be larger in order to cater for the extra elements in the email.</p>

<h3>Wireframe 5: Weather Feature</h3>
<img src="images\weather.JPG">
<p>This feature displays the current date and temperature. This will update live whenever the feature is opened. It will also display a seven day forecast of what the weather will be. Icons are used to represent different weather events, such as a cloud for a cloudy day. This allows the user to quickly glance at the screen to attain information.</p>

<h3>Wireframe 6: Checking Reminders</h3>
<img src="images\reminder.JPG">
<p>This feature lists any reminders that the user has set. Once a user completes a task, they can remove its corresponding reminder from the list via voice commands. They can also easily add reminders to the list via voice commands.</p>
