        <h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
   <p>  In order to complete the aims of our project, we are looking to use a piece of online software called Figma that is designed to 
       create wireframes for software. This will allow us to illustrate what the final product will look like in terms of its
        graphical user interface. We are also looking to to use Windows Movie Maker in order to create the pitch presentation for the project.
        Windows Movie Maker will allow us to stitch together recorded video from each group member as well as implement effects to create and enhance the video. </p>
        <p>To develop the website for the project, we are using Visual Studio Code to write the code for the website and we are uploading the code to
            GitHub in order to collaborate and share our progress on areas on areas of the assignment.
        </p>
        <p>To host meetings and communicate with each other, we are using Microsoft Teams as it allows us to easily host meetings to discuss progress on the project
            and raise any concerns we may have with its development.
        </p>
        <p>All of the software that we are using to complete the project is free to use. This allows every group member to have equitable access to it as there
            is no spending budget for this project.
        </p>
        <p>In terms of experience, Jack has a small amount of experience using figma and Visual Studio Code. Jaime has experience using windows movie maker
        which is not a program that will help the group create a professional video for our product. However Jaime does have experience using Visual Studio code
        and his knowledge of it is being implemented within the project. Yumi also has experience with windows movie maker and also has experience using Microsoft Teams,
            allowing her to effectively communicate with members of the group. Daniel has experience with Premiere Pro, iMovie and Final Cut as well as Visual Studio Code and Sublime text.
