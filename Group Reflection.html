   <p>Group Processes and Communication</p>
   <p>When we formed this group we made an agreement to Attend meetings once a week for Assignment 2, and then twice a week for assignment 3 as it was a larger undertaking. During the initial meetings for these assignments we tackled larger portions as a group such as the ‘ Plans and Progress’ and ‘Project Description’, then delegated smaller tasks such as updating the Git Repository, writing our profiles amongst us, with the goal to have them completed by the next meeting. If questions had arisen we would discuss them within the Microsoft Teams chat, and further clarity would be brought up in the next meeting. Everyone has upheld this agreement, and met all deadlines. More specific details of our processes are outlined below. We required those that were unable to attend meetings to provide notice of at least a day ahead, and then we would ask that they review the recordings of the meetings, and we would fill them in with more specific details within the teams chat. Communications outside of the Teams chats were usually mentioned within the next Meeting.</p>
