   <h3>Group Processes and Communication</h3>
   <p>When we formed this group we made an agreement to Attend meetings once a week for Assignment 2, and then twice a week for assignment 3 as it was a larger undertaking. During the initial meetings for these assignments we tackled larger portions as a group such as the ‘ Plans and Progress’ and ‘Project Description’, then delegated smaller tasks such as updating the Git Repository, writing our profiles amongst us, with the goal to have them completed by the next meeting. If questions had arisen we would discuss them within the Microsoft Teams chat, and further clarity would be brought up in the next meeting. Everyone has upheld this agreement, and met all deadlines. More specific details of our processes are outlined below. We required those that were unable to attend meetings to provide notice of at least a day ahead, and then we would ask that they review the recordings of the meetings, and we would fill them in with more specific details within the teams chat. Communications outside of the Teams chats were usually mentioned within the next Meeting.</p>

    <p>Overall, I think we all worked well as a group. Despite the fact that our personality tests indicated we wouldn't work well together, I think the differences in our personalities is ultimately what helped us tackle the assignments as a whole. 
        We all had strengths and weaknesses in different areas of IT and those contributed to us tackling the assignment as we could all conquer different areas and split off into groups, 
        as example with the Wireframes and Video Making when we split off into groups of three with each team handling designing the wireframes and making the video. 
        Of all the groups I've worked with throughout my first semester at RMIT, I would say that my Introduction to IT group has been one of the best.</p>
