    <div class="project">
         <h3>Aims</h3>
      <p>The aim of the project is to develop an easy to use smart mirror that allows users to interact with a modified version of the magic mirror operating system. In order to fulfill this aim, we need to complete smaller goals and hurdles. For example, we need to decide how many features the mirror will have in regards to the potential scope of the project vs the time we have to complete it. It is vital that we carefully consider how many features will be provided to the user in order to ensure that the provided features are working properly. It is better to deliver a smaller amount of features that all work, rather than include many features that remain buggy because there was not enough time to finish developing them. It is also important to consider how we are going to get the display of the mirror to work properly. We are looking to attach a display that is connected to raspberry pi to the back of the mirror. This will allow the light from the display to shine through the mirror. We will have to consider the thickness of the mirror as well as the brightness of the display in order for this to work.</p>
      <p> During development, another aim is to create the wireframes that will illustrate the potential look of the graphical user interface. This is important because it will give both users and investors an idea of what they can expect. This will assist in pitching towards investors in order to gain funding. Developing these wireframes will also centralise the idea of the project within the group so further development remains consistent and contradictions are prevented. </p>

       <p>Fundamentally, the most important parts of the project are installing functional software onto the raspberry pi and having it appear correctly on the mirror. This is because we need to ensure that there is a functional product at the end of the 14 week project in order for it to be successful. This is the main priority.
      </p>
        <p> With this main goal in mind, we need to ensure that the initial wireframes are developed to organise the team, users and investors during the course of the rest of the development of the smart mirror. This will also give us feedback from users which will allow us to develop a product that users want to use. There would be no point in developing a product if it is not something that users would be interested in. Feedback is vital to the product's success.
        </p>
       <p> Finally, we can look to implement extra features to the operating system to make its use more convenient for the user. This can include accessibility settings and features that are targeted towards the disabled such as text to speech and increasing text size through magnification.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p> Overview </p>
        <p>The big picture plan for our project is to change the productivity of an individual’s life. 
        We want the smart mirror to be the next calendar, where people consult the mirror for their shopping lists, memos, events and reminders. 
        The outcome of our project will be improving productivity in someone’s life.</p>
       <p>Another big picture goal that our group wanted to achieve with this product is the seamless transition of an individual's life into the digital world through this smart mirror. 
          This can be done by allowing individuals who do not usually interact with operating system based technology such as those in rural locations or the elderly to get used to its functions and find usefulness within it. 
        This could make them more likely to invest in more assistive technologies following their experience with the smart mirror. </p>

The production of our smart mirror will look to make life more convenient for the disabled as the generally large display will be easy to access by those with disabilities. 

   <p>
    The smart mirror is an android powered touch screen reflective surface that is designed to make mornings more convenient for the user. It incorporates a touch responsive surface onto a section of a mirror to allow the user to interact with the android operating system installed onto it. Currently the user can take advantage of most of the functionalities of android such as browsing the internet, installing apps, checking the weather and taking photos. Shopping online is even possible with the mirror’s internet connectivity.
   </p><p> The smart mirror is useful for people who are looking to be efficient on the go in the morning by quickly checking things such as emails on a non portable surface rather than having to pull their phone out of their pocket. As the mirror is running on android, it has an almost limitless amount of customisability, from changing widgets to wallpaper themes and fonts. This allows anyone to have their own style of smart mirror. The smart mirror uses a motion sensor to detect when a user is in the same room as it. This would then power on the display. This makes it more power efficient as the smart mirror is not always on, and only turns on when a user is within range of it. The mirror uses a display such as a monitor or a tablet to project what is being displayed through the glass of the mirror so that it is visible and can be interacted with by the user. Businesses can also use the smart mirror to replace whiteboards in terms of drawing up plans for projects and holding meetings on. This can allow mock up designs and wireframes for products to be drawn in a more realistic fashion via software, rather than drawing with a marker on a whiteboard. 
    </p>
    <p>The future of smart mirrors is broad, as the use they provide can easily fit the needs of younger generations who are more tech-savvy. Similar to smart mirrors, people are already utilizing smart phones and smart watches, which the concept is extremely alike, just with a few differences. Possibly in the next three years, smart mirror’s ability may increase to being able to automatically connect to phones, with the use of Bluetooth, when someone enters the bathroom. As homes are already becoming smart with light bulbs, light switches, TV, virtual AI and more, smart mirrors have a big potential to join the lines of these products and can integrate smoothly into a household. The functions of a smart mirror are very much like the typical smartphone, so whatever new possible function that becomes available to the smartphone could be available to smart mirrors too. For example, microphones could be added so the user can take calls whilst using the smart mirror and with Bluetooth, more possibilities are available with connecting to other smart products as mentioned before. Smart mirrors could have the potential to emulate many smartphone functions such as video calling if a camera was added, which would also open up the chance for online shopping where the user could “try” on the clothes virtually. With the camera it could also be used to place filters such as cosmetics, accessories and hairstyling, so the user can use it to help make a decision for their appearance. Smart mirrors also have a probable chance of being used as car mirrors, where dimming, self-cleaning, self-repairing features could be implemented into it. These features would solve problems such as foggy mirrors disrupting the driver. For example, Nissan hopes to input a LCD screen where it shows a suitable aspect ratio so driver’s can set their side mirrors correctly.</p>
    <p>Smart mirrors can potentially change the way we take part in online shopping. Through the incorporation of recognition software, retailers could potentially adopt a smart mirror, to provide other suggestions based on what the customer is looking for in terms of clothing, cosmetics, or other wearable goods. This would provide greater hygiene with retail stores, as customers are not testing products already tried by others and would facilitate the ability for staff to interact with customers through audio allowing for more productivity. Additionally, this could create greater convenience for home shoppers being able to virtually try on clothes, alleviating the need for physical staff. Also it can facilitate advertisements where users can digitally try on products.  Secondly the smart mirror can potentially be used as a health monitoring device. It could provide updates on an individual’s health and fitness having metrics such as daily steps or calorie intake having this information whilst the user is reflected in the mirror can help to motivate them to take a more considerate approach to health. Furthermore, the smart mirror could provide doctors with real time updates of a patient's health or monitor the anatomy of patients (Blum, Tobias & Kleeberger, Valerie & Bichlmeier, Christoph & Navab, Nassir 2012) and can increase the efficiency of physical therapy.  Also, there is a potential for the smart mirror to be used as a coaching or training device to facilitate learning through a visual means. Physical activities such as dancing could be undertaken or taught through the use of smart mirrors. This could improve participation in activities if the user were able to do it from home with a smart mirror, alleviating them from anxiety of undertaking those activities, but still have the mentoring environment. </p>
    <p>Users are often addicted to their smartphones which ultimately disrupts their schedule as they are surrounded by social media apps such as Instagram and Facebook. This could take away their focus from accomplishing tasks and maintaining an efficient schedule. Introducing the smart mirror, it is able to affect one’s life by limiting distractions that could lead to procrastination. By utilising the features on the smart mirror, it enables one to be productive throughout the day. The smart mirror offers elements that are essential to stay organised such as the ability to display basic information. It includes the weather forecast, temperature, current date, time, emails, reminders and a daily message. Rather than waking up and having the urge to check your phone for basic necessities such as the time or temperature, the smart mirror will immediately showcase the needs of the user. Not only does it limit the user’s screen time to urge efficiency, the smart mirror is able to assist the user with either online shopping or doctor consultations as well. For example, if someone is feeling unwell and transportation to the clinic is unavailable to them, they are able to access sessions with their preferred doctor. This greatly affects the health and wellbeing of the users as they do not have to rely on others to take them to the clinic as booking a consultation on the smart mirror would be enough to get them checked out. Likewise for online shopping, it would enable users to have access to goods without having the need to leave the comfort of their own home. For example, the mum in the family realised that they ran out of food but is unable to run to the shops as she has to take care of her baby, she could use the smart mirror to quickly order her groceries and have them delivered to her. Ultimately, the smart mirror aids in productivity and increases user convienience. </p><br><br>
    <h2>Plans and progress</h2><br>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Due to Covid-19 retail stores are currently shut down, and as a result there has been a huge boom in the online shopping industry. There are many advantages to online shopping such as the convenience of not having to leave your home, the wider range of products available and the ability to find the best deals. However, the disadvantage of online shopping is that you are unable to physically hold or test the product to see if it fulfils the needs you require it for. Often people order the wrong size of clothing, find out an item did not match the description or bought products on impulse.
        The smart mirror will alleviate this problem by allowing the user to browse and test products in an augmented reality space in their own home, allowing them to try on clothing, or see how products would fit in a design sense in their own homes, through the use of the smart mirror. This would also facilitate the smart mirror to be used as a marketing tool, having displayed users who pass the smart mirror with how the product may look on them.
        When waking up we often check our phones and it’s easy to get distracted with the other applications, youtube, facebook instagram etc. the smart mirror solves this as it can be used as an organisational tool that has all your notifications to update your day in one place, allowing you to go on with your morning routine, allowing for greater productivity for the user.  
        This project we will be building the smart mirror for this first set of consumers, wanting to use the mirror at home as an organisational tool and shopping. 
        When learning something, many people turn to the video tutorials as a means to acquire the knowledge and competencies on how to perform physical actions such as learning yoga, martial arts, new stretches or exercises and dancing. These activities require to view the video, and follow along, or practice the actions after and away from the video. With the smart mirror you are able to have both the video and the reflect on your learning at the same time making the learning process more efficient. Furthermore, this application of the smart mirror can be used as a means to monitor the health and recovery of patients involved in accidents or health issues that heavily reduces their motor skills, and it can also be used to measure metrics such as a person's cardiovascular health. Using augmented reality space of a smart mirror can show different areas of the body and provide users with the knowledge in dealing with issues such as physical therapy.
        </p>
        <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Our main competitor for the production and sale for smart mirrors is Embrace™ Smart Mirror. Embrace smart mirrors are a-high end product that retails for $999.00. They use the Android platform to create a motion-activated,  voice-activated touchscreen mirror. These mirrors are used like fully fledged web accessing devices, as through the Android platform this mirror is compatible with over 2 million apps.  Currently there is a lot of interest within the market for smart mirrors, with individuals resorting to different methods to obtaining one. Similar to the days when high-end PCs on the early 2000s were unobtainable for the average consumer, smart mirrors currently allude the average consumer who cannot afford the $999.00 price tag. This has created a new market for do-it-yourself smart mirrors. To create one individuals are purchasing regular mirrors, attaching low profile monitors and using Raspberry Pi or similar smaller computing devices to make the mirror “smart”. 
        Therefore we have two markets to compete with, the DIY market with a Raspberry Pi and the Embrace Smart Mirror. Our smart mirror aims to be programmed with the Android operating system. This gives our mirror an advantage over the do-it-yourself mirrors as the Android application list is far more expansive and useful for productivity. Comparatively, individuals need to create custom code for a Raspberry Pi mirror to work effectively. Our smart mirror has plans to be far more affordable than our Embrace Smart Mirror competitor. This means we can appeal to more consumers as our product becomes more affordable. The price range we are aiming for is around $350-$500 depending on size. The different sizes can help us reduce costs and also provide more options to our customers.
        Another use for our smart mirrors is for advertising. These mirrors can be eye-catching which some businesses can use to their advantage, where advertisements or interactive programs can entice potential customers into purchasing products.  
        The use of a smart product means that there are rules and regulations that must be followed regarding advertising and privacy laws. Mobile privacy laws tell us that it is imperative that our smart mirror integrates good privacy protections within the day-to-day business practices. We must ensure that our smart mirror has the correct practices, procedures and systems in place to comply with Australian Privacy Principles. These systems must allow us to make privacy enquiries and handle complaints. 
        </p>
    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>In order to complete the project of the smart mirror, team members will require different skill sets that can be adapted to the project. We will need people who demonstrate physical skills in regards to building the frame of the mirror and installing the touch display behind the mirror. There will also need to be team members who are capable in the Information Technology aspect of the project in regards to developing software to run on the display, as well as developing a way for the mirror itself to become a touch display. We will also need team members who are proficient in video editing in order to create the promotional pitch video in order to impress potential investors. 
        As there are only 14 weeks to complete the project, work needs to begin immediately in regards to brainstorming initial ideas for the product’s development. Funding will be gained from investors following a promotional video that will be created during the development of the smart mirror. Initial development will begin by researching products that are similar to our idea that already exist in order to gain inspiration that can assist during the development of the smart mirror. Following this, we will aim to decide on which operating system the smart mirror will be based on. This will likely be a modified version of the Android mobile operating system as it will allow access to the google play store. This will allow users to easily download applications to the smart mirror. This adds to the customizability potential of the product. In regards to the production of a promotional video, we will need to develop it with investors in mind. This means that we will need to show off the key features of the product, as well as reasons why it would be successful in the market. Extra details like these are ideal when pitching to investors as it will give them a reason to agree with our ideas and make them want the project to happen. If we created a generic advertisement video for our product, it would not be as likely to attract the investors. 
       </p>
    <h3>Designing</h3>
    <p>The smart mirror has the ability to display basic information which targets the day to day needs of the user such as the weather forecast, temperature, date and time. The home page will initially have these four features but can be customised according to what the user deems is important. Daily reminders and checklists will also be available as the goal of the smart mirror is for users to increase productivity. Likewise, this will aid with the process of being organised as having this feature will enable the user to visualise what is important to them. Such as, a reminder to hand in an assignment for school or a checklist for groceries when it’s time for shopping. To save the battery from being drained so easily, the smart mirror will also have a sleep mode where it will automatically go to sleep after five minutes of no motion being sensed. Forgetting to switch off the mirror would not be an issue for users due to this handy feature which focuses on efficiency. Information will be refreshed everyday as the mirror needs regular updates on temperature and weather forecast due to its constant change of pattern. By refreshing the page, the smart mirror is able to pick up the location of the user and the statistics of their area will immediately appear on the screen. Similarly, the time and date are also customisable to suit the needs of the user. Two options of either having it set up as 12 or 24 hours is available, and the format can either be digitally or analog. Different users have their own preferences so by expanding the design and not limiting to one, will appeal to many. Users are also given the option to link the mirror to their email address so that notifications are able to be displayed on the screen. If an email has not been opened, it could pop up under daily reminders to inform them of this action. Lastly, another feature provided by the smart mirror are daily messages. This will be generated by the software itself rather than user input. Messages that are displayed would be positive and uplifting compliments, this will aim to improve the health and wellbeing of users. 
</p>
    <h3>Aquiring Materials</h3>
    <p>For our smart mirror we’re going to require a few components to make it work. Most of what we’re looking for is fairly inexpensive and is easily acquirable. First of all, we need a Raspberry Pi which is essentially a single board computer that is used to teach computer science. These can be purchased online for a reasonable price. Due to the complexity of our project, the best option would be a Raspberry Pi 3 which goes for about $50-$60. Raspberry Pi 3 would work the best as it has built in Wi-Fi and HDMI. Next we’ll need a monitor, the monitor will be placed behind the smart mirror so that it can project information such as time, weather and notifications onto it. This is also fairly inexpensive depending on what size monitor you buy and in some cases the ordinary household will have a spare monitor lying around. The third item we’ll need is a two-way mirror. The reason the mirror has to be two way is so we can place a monitor behind it and have information projected onto the other size. Two-way mirrors can generally be bought in store or online and some websites even give you the option to customise the dimensions of the mirror before you buy it, this could be useful to us so we can customise the mirror to our own needs. Another component is an HDMI cable however that is generally an everyday household item that can be acquired. Software wise, we will be using the Android operating system as it is generally compatible with most software around so it’ll make it easier for us to implement it into our smart mirror. There is also repositories that can be found online that come with all the software built in for making a smart mirror. An example is MagicMirror which only requires installation onto the Raspberry Pi and the interface can then be customised and projected onto the mirror, eliminating the need for us to design it from scratch and this can save time, money and resources.

          </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>During development of the smart mirror, we will aim to give users several opportunities to test our product before it is released onto the market. This can start once we have a basic idea of how the graphical user interface of the product will look and low fidelity wireframes are created. We will begin with using Paper User Testing in order to allow users to explore different keypath scenarios within the product. The data gained from these initial tests will give us an indication of what users like and dislike about the potential design of the product. In order to find users for our test, we will employ guerrilla user testing in which people will be asked without prior notice if they want to try the design of the product. This ensures that users have not researched smart mirrors leading upto the test, giving us a genuine first impression of the design. Following this, high fidelity prototypes of the smart mirror near the end of development in order to get an idea of what user feedback of the final product may look like.</p>
    <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
        <p>When working on our project, it is evident that there is a limit to how large we can make the scope of it due to time constraints. In the four week period we have to develop our idea for our project, we are looking to plan out what could be the potential development process of the final product. This includes creating basic wireframes that illustrate the potential of the graphical user interface as well as creating keypath scenarios that users could follow when using the product. In the time available, it is not logical that the completed high fidelity product will be completed as organising/developing software and hardware for the mirror will take longer than the four week period available. There are ambitions to add features to what the final product could be, however the scope creep phenomenon may hinder the ability for the group to create adequate deliverables for the project. Along with basic wireframes for the product, we are also looking to include images of concept ideas that represent the look of the final product. </p>
