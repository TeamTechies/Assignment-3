        <h3>Skills and Jobs</h3>
   <p>  There are several different job positions that would need to be filled to take our product to the next phase. These skilled roles would include a creative director who would be able to envision the future of the magic mirror. They would have the creative direction to highlight what the magic mirror can do for consumers. Another role would be the lead designers. It would be important for them to get the fundamental look of the mirror to match the aesthetic that the creative visionaries saw, while also achieving the goal of squeezing the mirror, LCD screen and Raspberry Pi technology into a slim low-profile design. The magic mirror would also need software developers to be able to code and debug any software glitches, hence weâ€™d require developers experienced in Java and Python. The software developers would be able to take the project to the next phase, opening up the magic mirror to more possibilities. This is through the integration of more applications and the seamlessness of using the mirror. This project would need to include staff members who have experience working on technological projects released to the public. This includes having a usable UI that everyday consumers could use with relative ease. The UI designers would play a very important part in determining the success of this project. The UI of the smart mirror is imperative for making the overall flow and productiveness of the product work efficiently, without being too intrusive.  </p>
