        I completed the VCE in 2019 and graduated from Rosebud Secondary College that same year. I have a cat named Missy and my hobby is playing video games. My interest in IT covers a wide range of areas from troubleshooting, to programming, to working with physical components, My interest began when I was very young when my dad showed me basic functions of CAD software. Seeing the shapes on the screen change sizes sparked my interest. I have previously completed a Cert II in Computer Assembly and Repair which was a two year course that introduced me to networking and troubleshooting. Beginning work on assignment 2 for Intro to Information Technology, I have joined Team Techies. My team appears to be ready to complete the assignment to the best of their ability.<br><br>
                                                
        I am aiming to become an analyst programmer once I finish get my Bachelorâ€™s degree, this role would become a stepping stone to jumpstart my career in IT, where I can learn new skills by completing project under an IT manager, eventually progressing further into the organisational hierarchy.</p>

		Born in Australia with a Filipino heritage, I am currently in my final semester studying a Bachelor of Business (Economics and Finance) at RMIT University. Outside of my academic endeavours, I enjoy spending a fun evening with my friends playing Magic the Gathering, or something from my collection of board games, or hanging out with my American Pitbull rescue (R.I.P). I believe having some foundational knowledge into IT is necessary to remain competitive within the economic and finance industry with globalisation and how fast technology is progressing. The extent of my IT knowledge is using basic software such as PowerPoint, excel, outlook etc, which is why i have decided to take on IT electives to further my knowledge.<br><br>
		
		My ideal job within the IT industry is to become a data scientist, as currently my undergraduate degree is majoring economic and finance which looks at data to determine why something is the way it is or make predictions of what may happen.<br><br>
    During assignment 2 our group was very well organised and everyone was able to meet deadlines that was set. There were clear lines of communication using Microsoft Teams and everybody was able to attend meetings. For Assignment 3 we have decided to have mor meetings in order to get the project done more efficiently and ensure we have our camera's turned on.</p>
