        I completed the VCE in 2019 and graduated from Rosebud Secondary College that same year. I have a cat named Missy and my hobby is playing video games. My interest in IT covers a wide range of areas from troubleshooting, to programming, to working with physical components, My interest began when I was very young when my dad showed me basic functions of CAD software. Seeing the shapes on the screen change sizes sparked my interest. I have previously completed a Cert II in Computer Assembly and Repair which was a two year course that introduced me to networking and troubleshooting. Beginning work on assignment 2 for Intro to Information Technology, I have joined Team Techies. My team appears to be ready to complete the assignment to the best of their ability.<br><br>
                                                
        I am aiming to become an analyst programmer once I finish get my Bachelorâ€™s degree, this role would become a stepping stone to jumpstart my career in IT, where I can learn new skills by completing project under an IT manager, eventually progressing further into the organisational hierarchy.</p>
