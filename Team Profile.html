            Personal Information:<br>
            My name is Jack Croll, my RMIT student number is s3844802 and I have an interest in programming within IT. My interest in IT began when I was very young when my dad showed me basic functions of CAD software. Seeing the shapes on the screen change sizes sparked my interest. I have previously completed a Cert II in Computer Assembly and Repair which was a two year course that introduced me to networking and troubleshooting.<br><br>

	   <br>Role: Java Developer<br>
		<br>Born in Australia with a Filipino heritage, I am currently in my final semester studying a Bachelor of Business (Economics and Finance) at RMIT University. Outside of my academic endeavours, I enjoy spending a fun evening with my friends playing Magic the Gathering, or something from my collection of board games, or hanging out with my American Pitbull rescue (R.I.P). I believe having some foundational knowledge into IT is necessary to remain competitive within the economic and finance industry with globalisation and how fast technology is progressing. The extent of my IT knowledge is using basic software such as PowerPoint, excel, outlook etc, which is why i have decided to take on IT electives to further my knowledge.<br><br>

	<img src = "images\profilephotos\a1.PNG" height="250" width="200">
	<br> Role: Raspberry Pi Developer </br>
<p> I am 21 years old and I turn 22 in May. My student number is s3661286 and I can be contacted through my email s3661286@student.rmit.edu.au </p>
<p> I am a first generation Australian, as both my parents were born in countries outside of Australia. My mother was originally born in Germany and my father was originally born in England.
	<p> One thing that I like to do in my spare time that would be interesting to other people is that I like to DJ and mix music, I use specialised mixing decks to do this. </p> 
	<p> My interest in IT started at a young age, as I became interested in Windows PC's and would frequent my relatives and friends houses to help them fix computer issues that they are having. </p>	  
	
	<br><br><br><h3>Daniel Viglietti - s3844180</h3><br>
	<img src = "images\profilephotos\DanielProfile.jpeg" height="250" width="200">
	 <p>Role: Video Editor<p>
       <p> Born on the 11th of July 2001, I’m of Australian nationality but my heritage is Italian. I essentially taught myself as a child to use computers, since the age of four I’ve been immersed around technology and luckily that passion has remained for essentially my entire life and it had gotten 
	       to the point where I now assist others with their IT needs.. 
	       I speak both English and Italian (very lightly) and my hobbies include Computers, Cars, Screenwriting, Filmmaking and Video Editing. If I had to choose three things that I strongly dislike, they would be: Liars, Uptight People, Telstra and people who hate when I follow the speed limit. 
	       I haven’t had any professional experience in IT and my experience comes from what I’ve taught my, my history using computers and IT classes at school, I have three years of Visual Basic experience (RIP to that as of 2020). 
	       My main interest in IT is Cybersecurity and I would like to get a job in that industry such as an Analyst, Director of a Security Team, or a white hat hacker for a large corporation or Government agency. 
	       If I had to pick on those positions though, it would be working as a Director of an Information security team for a corporation, outside of the obvious monetary benefits, having a chance to lead a team of security analyst is very appealing to me, and hopefully studying at RMIT university will give me the skills to acquire this career goal.</p>

		<img src = "images\profilephotos\image.JPG" height="250" width="200"><br>
	<p> Role: UI Designer <br>
	I moved to Australia 7 years ago and I’ve settled quite well in Melbourne. During my free time, I often watch baking videos and experiment with the recipes I’ve found interesting. Apart from making desserts, my favourite aspect of IT is design. Being able to turn a storyboard into a website where users are able to interact with is something that I’m passionate about! I have a passion in design and want to use my creativity in developing fun and efficient interactions for users to ensure a pleasant IT experience, because of this my ideal role within the IT industry is to become a User interface designer.I used to do folio subjects back in high school, so I do have experience with software such as Adobe photoshop and illustrator. Though for the future, I would have to be fluent in essential front-end web development languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create an application from scratch. </p>

	<p><br><br><br> <h3>Yumi Truong - s3842533</h3> <br>
		<img src = "images\profilephotos\studentpic_yt.PNG" height="250" width="200">
	<br> Role: UI Designer <br>
	My birthplace is Vietnam but I moved to Australia when I was a year old. My ethnicity is Chinese and I can speak English, Cantonese and Japanese (at a conversational level). I am currently in my first semester of Bachelor’s of Information Technology and recently graduated from high school. My hobbies include playing badminton and video games. In the field of IT, I am interested in the development of new and existing technology that assists people in everyday life. Such as developing websites and apps, communication technology, smart assistants, car technology and more. As for my IT experience, currently I have no qualifications and very little experience with web development and coding. I am looking to become a Web Developer as my future career goal within the IT industry, as it would utilise my passion with both graphic design and coding, which I hope to develop whilst studying.<br><br>
	</p>
<br><br><h3> Group Processes </h3></br>
<p> 
Our group worked well in Assignment 3, where we were able to delegate roles to one another and finish our assignment at the required deadline. 
	Our group was also able to attain a high mark for Assignment 2, due to the high standard and quality of the work completed. 
	Team Techies decided that it would be optimal to ensure that the group processes and dynamics remain similar to Assignment 2, so that the workflow and standard of work remains the same if not similar. 
	However, one process that our group will need to implement for Assignment 3 is more consistent communication over the coming weeks. 
	During Assignment 2 our discussions were held mostly in meetings and our ideas came from when we were together as a group. 
	This assignment is far larger in scale than Assignment 2 and will require us to work and communicate outside of just official meetings. Therefore, our communication will have to develop further if we are to succeed in this assignment. 
</p>
<br><br><h3>Career Plan</h3><br>
<p>Ronnel career path of Data Scientist deals with manipulating raw data to assist in the decision making of management and those higher up on the business hierarchy. Whilst the rest of the team will be in roles where they will be delegated tasks pertaining to client specifications. Rons role is more analytically oriented and will be focused on using data base tools such as SQL.</p>
<p>Jaimes'and Yumi's goal is to become web developers, Anisahs goal is to become a UI designer and Jack wants to be a Analyst programmer. These roles lean heavily towards their creative abilities, in designing features for apps and websites. Furthermore these jobs will be utilising software such as Python and Java.</p>
<p>Daniel's is looking to become a IT Specialist, which requires a greater technical knowledge of attack vectors that hackers may use, and the software associated with them. In this role Daniel will likely be dealing with simulations and security software to create innovative preemptive defenses against attacks.</p>
