        <br>Role: Lead Developer<br>
         <p>   Team Name: Team Techies<br>
		 
            Personal Information:<br>
            My name is Jack Croll, my RMIT student number is s3844802 and I have an interest in programming within IT. My interest in IT began when I was very young when my dad showed me basic functions of CAD software. Seeing the shapes on the screen change sizes sparked my interest. I have previously completed a Cert II in Computer Assembly and Repair which was a two year course that introduced me to networking and troubleshooting.<br><br>
            
            Group Processes:<br>
             Overall, my team worked to a high standard in assignment 2 and it is evident that the group has determination to work to the same, if not, higher standard during assignment 3. In assignment 3 there is a goal to make the roles of each team member more evident in order to make workflow more streamlined.<br><br>
            
            Career Plans:<br>
            
            In Team Techies, there are many different career paths that members are wanting to take. For example, Ronnel is aiming to become a data scientist which involves working with data and representing it in an easy to read way. This is different to my ideal job as an Analyst Programmer which deals directly with the design of products. A similarity that has been noticed across all members of Team Techies is that their ideal roles all involve working with other people in a group to reach a certain outcome. Because of this, the group assignments from the Introduction to IT course allow each member to work toward the goal of improved group communication skills.<br><br>

            
        <p><br><br><br><h3>Ronnel Purino - s348907</h3><br>
            <p>Role: Java Developer</p>
		Born in Australia with a Filipino heritage, I am currently in my final semester studying a Bachelor of Business (Economics and Finance) at RMIT University. Outside of my academic endeavours, I enjoy spending a fun evening with my friends playing Magic the Gathering, or something from my collection of board games, or hanging out with my American Pitbull rescue (R.I.P). I believe having some foundational knowledge into IT is necessary to remain competitive within the economic and finance industry with globalisation and how fast technology is progressing. The extent of my IT knowledge is using basic software such as PowerPoint, excel, outlook etc, which is why i have decided to take on IT electives to further my knowledge.<br><br>

        Career Plans:<br>
		
		My ideal job within the IT industry is to become a data scientist, as currently my undergraduate degree is majoring economic and finance which looks at data to determine why something is the way it is or make predictions of what may happen.<br><br>
    During assignment 2 our group was very well organised and everyone was able to meet deadlines that was set. There were clear lines of communication using Microsoft Teams and everybody was able to attend meetings. For Assignment 3 we have decided to have more meetings in order to get the project done efficiently, and to ensure we have our camera's turned on. Also we have divided tasks based on proficiency for instance Jack has greater technical skills in css, with input from Anisah who is proficient in design. the rest of the team will work with Yumi, in providing research and planning our her vision of a Magic Mirror, and as we progress with each section we will commit those tasks in the Git Repository.</p>
        
	<br><br><br> <h3>Jaime Pope - s3661286 </h3></br>
	<br> Role: Raspberry Pi Developer </br>
<p> I am 21 years old and I turn 22 in May. My student number is s3661286 and I can be contacted through my email s3661286@student.rmit.edu.au </p>
<p> I am a first generation Australian, as both my parents were born in countries outside of Australia. My mother was originally born in Germany and my father was originally born in England.
	<p> One thing that I like to do in my spare time that would be interesting to other people is that I like to DJ and mix music, I use specialised mixing decks to do this. </p> 
	<p> My interest in IT started at a young age, as I became interested in Windows PC's and would frequent my relatives and friends houses to help them fix computer issues that they are having. </p>	  
	
	<br><br><br><h3>Daniel Viglietti - s3844180</h3><br>
	 <p>Role: Video Maker<p>
       <p> Born on the 11th of July 2001, I’m of Australian nationality but my heritage is Italian (so don’t start arguments with me because no argues better than Italians). 
	       I essentially taught myself as a child to use computers, since the age of four I’ve been immersed around technology and luckily that passion has remained for essentially my entire life and it had gotten to the point where I now assist others with their IT needs. (Mac is better than Windows). 
	       I speak both English and Italian (very lightly) and my hobbies include Computers, Cars, Screenwriting, Filmmaking and Video Editing. If I had to choose three things that I strongly dislike, they would be: Liars, Uptight People, Telstra and people who hate when I follow the speed limit. 
	       I haven’t had any professional experience in IT and my experience comes from what I’ve taught my, my history using computers and IT classes at school, I have three years of Visual Basic experience (RIP to that as of 2020). 
	       My main interest in IT is Cybersecurity and I would like to get a job in that industry such as an Analyst, Director of a Security Team, or a white hat hacker for a large corporation or Government agency. 
	       If I had to pick on those positions though, it would be working as a Director of an Information security team for a corporation, outside of the obvious monetary benefits, having a chance to lead a team of security analyst is very appealing to me, and hopefully studying at RMIT university will give me the skills to acquire this career goal.</p>
      
	<p><br><br><br><h3>Anisah Isa - s384460</h3> <br>
	I moved to Australia 7 years ago and I’ve settled quite well in Melbourne. During my free time, I often watch baking videos and experiment with the recipes I’ve found interesting. Apart from making desserts, my favourite aspect of IT is design. Being able to turn a storyboard into a website where users are able to interact with is something that I’m passionate about! I have a passion in design and want to use my creativity in developing fun and efficient interactions for users to ensure a pleasant IT experience, because of this my ideal role within the IT industry is to become a User interface designer.

	<p><br><br><br> <h3>Yumi Truong - s3842533</h3> <br>
	My birthplace is Vietnam but I moved to Australia when I was a year old. My ethnicity is Chinese and I can speak English, Cantonese and Japanese (at a conversational level). I am currently in my first semester of Bachelor’s of Information Technology and recently graduated from high school. My hobbies include playing badminton and video games. In the field of IT, I am interested in the development of new and existing technology that assists people in everyday life. Such as developing websites and apps, communication technology, smart assistants, car technology and more. As for my IT experience, currently I have no qualifications and very little experience with web development and coding. I am looking to become a Web Developer as my future career goal within the IT industry, as it would utilise my passion with both graphic design and coding, which I hope to develop whilst studying.<br><br>
	In Assignment 2, our group worked well together and we all contributed a good amount towards the assignment. We were all present for all meetings and effectively communicated with one another. In Assignment 3, as it requires much more work, our group has decided to hold meetings twice a week instead of once. This is so we can more productively complete the assignment.</p>
